/**
 * =============================================================================
 * playwright.config.ts — The control center of the test framework
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 *   Central, version-controlled configuration for HOW tests run: parallelism,
 *   retries, timeouts, reporters, and shared HTTP request settings. One file
 *   governs local runs AND CI, so behavior is reproducible everywhere.
 *
 * WHAT PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
 *   Without it, every test would re-declare base URLs, headers, and timeouts
 *   (DRY violation). Here we define them ONCE; every test inherits them via the
 *   `request` fixture and `use` block.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 *   Playwright reads `defineConfig(...)` at startup. For an API-only framework
 *   we skip browsers entirely and lean on the built-in `APIRequestContext`
 *   (exposed to tests as the `request` fixture).
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE:
 *   - Drive environment-specific values (baseURL, retries) from env vars so the
 *     SAME config works for dev/staging/prod and local/CI without edits.
 *   - Fail the build if `test.only` is left in code (forbidOnly on CI).
