/**
 * =============================================================================
 * api.fixtures.ts — Dependency Injection via Playwright fixtures
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 *   Tests need a ready-to-use ApiClient bound to the correct base URL — and they
 *   should NOT build/dispose request contexts themselves (that's plumbing, and
 *   forgetting to dispose leaks resources). Fixtures inject the client and handle
 *   its full lifecycle automatically.
 *
 * WHAT PROBLEM IT SOLVES (Dependency Injection):
 *   The test declares WHAT it needs (`{ httpbin }`) and receives a working
 *   instance. It depends on an abstraction handed to it, not on construction
 *   details — the core idea of DI, and what makes tests clean and swappable.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 *   `base.extend<Fixtures>()` adds named fixtures. Each fixture:
 *     1) creates a dedicated APIRequestContext with the right baseURL,
 *     2) wraps it in an ApiClient,
 *     3) `await use(client)` hands it to the test,
 *     4) disposes the context AFTER the test (teardown) — no leaks.
 *
 * WHEN TO USE:
 *   Import `test` and `expect` from THIS module (not '@playwright/test') in any
 *   spec that needs an injected client:
 *     import { test, expect } from '@fixtures/api.fixtures';
 *     test('...', async ({ httpbin }) => { ... });
