/**
 * =============================================================================
 * booking.factory.ts — BookingFactory (FACTORY pattern)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 *   While the Builder is for FINE-GRAINED, per-test customization, the Factory
 *   provides NAMED, ready-made scenarios behind a single call. Tests that just
 *   need "a valid booking" or "an invalid booking" shouldn't repeat builder
 *   chains — they ask the factory by intent.
 *
 * BUILDER vs FACTORY (the interview answer):
 *   - Builder: "assemble exactly the object I describe, step by step."
 *   - Factory: "give me a pre-configured object for THIS scenario."
 *   They compose: the Factory USES the Builder internally (DRY) — one source of
 *   default truth, two ergonomic entry points.
