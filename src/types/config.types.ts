/**
 * =============================================================================
 * config.types.ts — The TYPE CONTRACT for all framework configuration
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS:
 *   Defines the exact shape of validated config the rest of the framework can
 *   rely on. Once env vars pass through ConfigManager, everything downstream
 *   consumes this strongly-typed object instead of touching `process.env`
 *   (which is always `string | undefined` and unsafe).
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE:
 *   Centralize the "single source of truth" type so a new config field is added
 *   in exactly ONE place and the compiler flags every spot that must handle it.
 * =============================================================================
